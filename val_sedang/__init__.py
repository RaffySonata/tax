For oTree beginners, it would be simpler to implement this as a discrete-time game 
by using multiple rounds, e.g. 10 rounds, where in each round both players can make a new proposal,
or accept the value from the previous round.

However, the discrete-time version has more limitations
(fixed communication structure, limited number of iterations).

Also, the continuous-time version works smoother & faster, 
and is less resource-intensive since it all takes place in 1 page.
